# Calendar-Scheduler

This Calendar scheduler allows the user to enter taks in the corresponding time slots. The time slots dynamically update throughout the date according to the current time. Grey indicates the past, red indicates the current hour, and green indicates the future. Each entry is saved into local storage and displayed again when the page is reloaded
